## 📥 Getting Started

The full project assets (~4.6GB) are hosted as a formal release. Due to file size constraints, the project is provided in **three compressed volumes**.

### How to Download
1. Navigate to the **[Releases](https://github.com/bakethi/Holodeck/releases)** section.
2. Under **Assets**, download **all three** parts:
   * `Holodeck.zip.001`
   * `Holodeck.zip.002`
   * `Holodeck.zip.003`

### Installation & Extraction
1. **Move all parts** into the same folder on your computer. 
2. **Keep the filenames exactly as they are** (do not rename them).
3. Right-click the **first file** (`Holodeck.zip.001`) and select **"Extract Here"** using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/).
   * *The software will automatically detect and merge the remaining parts to recreate the full folder.*
4. Follow the [docs](https://dronemanager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/holodeck.html) for further configuration in Unity.
